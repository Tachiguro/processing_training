# Projekt "Processing Abenteuer" 🚀
Welcome to our exciting project "Processing Adventure"! Here, developers jherzog and aherzog initiated this project to expand their skills and learn something new. 🖥️💡

# Overview #
In this repository, we deepen our programming knowledge using the book "Learn Programming with Processing." We not only share our own solutions to the tasks but also provide example codes that might be of interest to other developers.

# Project Goals #
📚 Self-Development: By working with the book, we enhance our skills and deepen our understanding of the world of programming.
🤝 Sharing and Inspiring: The example codes serve not only as learning tools for us but also aim to inspire other developers and help them realize their own projects.
🚀 Continuous Progress: Each completed task marks a milestone on our journey. We update regularly and share our progress with the community.
# Tasks #
1.	🚥 Introduction to Processing: Basics and first steps
2.	🎨 Creative Drawings: Creating artistic visualizations
3.	🔄 Animations: Dynamic movements and smooth transitions
4.	🕹️ Interactive Projects: Games and user interaction
5.	🌐 Networking: Integrating network communication into our applications

# Get Involved #
We invite all interested developers to participate in our project! Use the example codes as inspiration and share your own solutions with the community. Together, we can learn from each other and grow collectively.

We hope that this project is not only educational and inspiring for us but also for the entire developer community. 🌟 Happy coding!
